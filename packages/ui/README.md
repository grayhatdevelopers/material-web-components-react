# Material Web Components for React

> Warning: This is beta software. Use at your own discretion.

A thin React wrapper over [@material/web](https://github.com/material-components/material-web/). Aims to be a locally-installable, accessible and customizable Material standard for React. Recommended to use with [MUI](https://mui.com/). Free. Open Source. **Looking for maintainers**.

## Installation
To use Material Web Components for React as a **library** in your project, run:
```sh
npm install material-web-components-react
```

## Documentation

Under the hood, this library simply uses the official [@material/web](https://github.com/material-components/material-web/) components. Visit [the official Material Web Components docs](https://github.com/material-components/material-web/blob/main/docs/intro.md) to learn how to use those components. The props remain the same!

## Contributing

We're looking for maintainers and contributors!

### Roadmap ðŸš€
- [ ] Make sure all native Web Components are properly working
    - [x] Demo all components
    - [x] Add all missing events
    - [ ] Add theming (design tokens) through Tailwind (i.e. remove all ts-ignores)
- [x] Resolve SSR/SSG issues, make compatible with NextJS (i.e. remove all dynamic imports)
- [x] Separate the demo from the actual UI code
- [ ] Make installable as a package. Preferably keep the code in-project, like shadcn/ui, so developers have more control
- [ ] Add better TypeScript support
- [ ] Sync with upstream (i.e. https://github.com/material-components/material-web/blob/main/docs/intro.md) through webhooks and automations
    - [ ] Use [Copybara](https://github.com/google/copybara) (or good ol' GitHub webhooks) to automate syncing with upstream
    - [ ] Use [lit-analyzer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lit-analyzer) to see which Web Components changed. Perhaps mix with an LLM to compare existing and newly autogenerated code.
    - [ ] Create a PR with the new Component code.
- [ ] Mix this library with Tailwind and BaseUI in order to complete missing Components which may prove useful for building production applications
