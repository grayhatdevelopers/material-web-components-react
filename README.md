A thin React wrapper over [@material/web](https://github.com/material-components/material-web/). Aims to be a locally-installable, accessible and customizable Material standard for React. Recommended to use with [MUI](https://mui.com/). Free. Open Source. **Looking for maintainers**.

## Installation

To use Material Web Components for React as a **library** in your project, run:

```sh
npm install material-web-components-react
```

## Usage

Here's a general example of how the components can be used:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import Button from 'material-web-components-react/button';

function Example() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

For a detailed reference on usage, you might want to check out the source code of the [NextJS demo](https://github.com/grayhatdevelopers/material-web-components-react/blob/main/apps/demo/src/app/page.tsx). It's simple!

Under the hood, this library simply uses the official [@material/web](https://github.com/material-components/material-web/) components. Visit [the official Material Web Components docs](https://github.com/material-components/material-web/blob/main/docs/intro.md) to learn how to use those components. The props remain the same!

## Contributing

We're looking for maintainers and contributors!

### Roadmap ðŸš€

- [ ] Make sure all native Web Components are properly working
  - [x] Demo all components
  - [x] Add all missing events
  - [ ] [Need help] Add theming (design tokens) through Tailwind (i.e. remove all ts-ignores) (https://github.com/grayhatdevelopers/material-web-components-react/pull/2)
- [x] Resolve SSR/SSG issues, make compatible with NextJS (i.e. remove all dynamic imports)
- [x] Separate the demo from the actual UI code
- [x] Make installable as a package.
- [ ] [Need help] Make installable as code-in-project, like shadcn/ui, so developers have more control (https://github.com/grayhatdevelopers/material-web-components-react/pull/11)
- [ ] [Need help] Add better TypeScript support (https://github.com/grayhatdevelopers/material-web-components-react/issues/12)
- [ ] Sync with upstream (i.e. https://github.com/material-components/material-web/blob/main/docs/intro.md) through webhooks and automations
  - [ ] Use [Copybara](https://github.com/google/copybara) (or good ol' GitHub webhooks) to automate syncing with upstream
  - [ ] Use [lit-analyzer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lit-analyzer) to see which Web Components changed. Perhaps mix with an LLM to compare existing and newly autogenerated code.
  - [ ] Create a PR with the new Component code.
- [ ] Mix this library with Tailwind and BaseUI in order to complete missing Components which may prove useful for building production applications
  - [x] App Bars
    - [x] Top App Bar
    - [x] Bottom App Bar
  - [x] Stack
  - [x] Box
  - [x] Navigation Rail
  - [x] Container
  - [x] Typography

### Credits

Huge shout out to Elizabeth Mitchell ([asyncLiz](https://github.com/asyncliz/)) and the rest of the Material Design team for their awesome Web Components implementation.

Thank you [Travis Reeder](https://github.com/treeder) for your Web Component implementation of Navigation Rail. I had to copy it to this project. I couldn't use yours directly because it would import `@material/web` again and bring conflicts.

Thanks for making the crappy, brain-dead wrapper components:
